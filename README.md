# 8N1Term  
**A next-generation serial terminal that removes friction, not adds it.**

8N1Term is a modern re-thinking of the classic serial terminal.  
No menus. No modal dialogs. No digging through settings. No ASCII charts.  
Everything you need is **on screen, visible, and immediately usable**.

This is a terminal designed for engineers, not for screenshots.

## Philosophy

Traditional terminals are stuck in the 1990s:
- Hidden features behind menus
- ASCII tables on Google
- Cryptic shortcuts
- Mode confusion (text vs hex vs raw)
- Endless configuration panels

8N1Term does the opposite.

> **If you need it while working, it’s on screen. If it’s not essential, it’s not there.**

The goal is zero cognitive overhead. You focus on the device, not the tool.

## Core Features

### 🧠 On-Screen ASCII Keyboard (No Charts Ever Again)
- Full ASCII character set available via **clickable on-screen keyboard**
- Instantly send control characters, non-printables, and edge cases
- No more “what was 0x1B again?” moments
- Works alongside normal typing

You will literally **never need to look up an ASCII table again**.

---

### ⌨️ Dual Input: Click or Type
- **Click characters** on the on-screen keyboard  
- **Type directly** using your physical keyboard  
- Mix both seamlessly

This sounds obvious. Almost no terminals get this right.

---

### 🧩 All Sane Options, Always Visible
- Baud rate, port, encoding, modes, line endings, etc.  
- No menus  
- No dropdown hunting  
- No modal configuration screens  

Everything is:
- Visible
- Obvious
- One click away

If you have to “go find” a feature, it doesn’t belong.

---

### 🪟 Single-Surface UI – No Mode Switching
- No separate “settings view”
- No context loss
- No UI state surprises

You see the terminal.  
You see the controls.  
You use the terminal.

That’s it.

---

### 📤 Raw, As-Is, and Hex – Cleanly Separated
- **As-Is**: exactly what was received, displayed as-is  
- **Hex Representation**: clean, formatted, controlled line length  
- **Raw Save**: byte-perfect output, no interpretation  

No ambiguity. No guessing what was transformed. No silent conversions.

---

### ⚡ Designed for Real Engineering Work
This is built for:
- Firmware bring-up
- Protocol debugging
- Binary streams
- Weird devices
- Dirty serial lines
- Long sessions
- Large buffers

It does not assume your data is pretty.  
It does not assume your device is polite.

## What Makes 8N1Term Different

| Typical Terminal | 8N1Term |
|------------------|---------|
| ASCII charts in browser | On-screen ASCII keyboard |
| Hidden menus | Everything visible |
| Modal dialogs | Single surface UI |
| Mode confusion | Explicit, labeled modes |
| Mouse or keyboard | Mouse **and** keyboard, always |
| Configuration first | Work first |

## Design Rules (Non-Negotiable)

These are intentional constraints:

- ❌ No menu bars  
- ❌ No nested settings dialogs  
- ❌ No “advanced” tabs  
- ❌ No feature hiding  

- ✅ Everything visible  
- ✅ Everything direct  
- ✅ Everything obvious  

If it adds friction, it’s rejected.

---

## Status

8N1Term is actively developed and already usable for real work.  
The focus is on:

- Stability  
- Clarity  
- Zero-friction workflows  
- Engineer-first UX  

This is not a “pretty terminal”.  
It’s a **useful** one.

---

## Name

**8N1Term**  
Because the fundamentals still matter.  
And because most tools forgot that.
